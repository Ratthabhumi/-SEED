## v0.26.1 IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW

1. **Evidence Integrity & Audit Corrections (`tests/emergence/distribution.audit.test.ts`)**:
   - **Class A Metric Truth**:
     - Denominator explicitly bound to genuinely observed draft samples (`observedDraftSamples = 6000`).
     - Separated `collidingFingerprintGroupRate` (15.90%, fraction of unique fingerprint groups appearing > 1 time) from `duplicateDraftSampleFrequency` (53.97%, true duplicate sample frequency across all drafts).
     - Reroll pool alternative candidate availability verified at 56.50% (> 8%).
     - Real age buckets (stone..space) verified with zero age quality clamping (all 4 qualities present).
   - **Class B Simulation Boundary Clarification**:
     - Verified 48-run factorial simulation matrix (3 seeds × 4 origins × 4 policies).
     - Explicitly clarified that runs test up to 40 seconds of canonical simulation time (2,400 steps @ 60 Hz).
     - Distinguishes canonical physics progression (`sim.step`) and direct simulation API actions (`claimTerritory`, `tryAbility`) from human UI interactions. EXPANDER claims (54 outposts) and AGGRESSOR ability uses (20) prove autonomous simulation capability, NOT player onboarding or human enjoyment.
   - **Class C Scope Alignment**:
     - Renamed to `[Class C: Single-Draft Offer & First-Pick Heuristic Divergence]`.
     - Documented that this evaluates single-draft offer engine divergence after staged Knowledge injection (`gainKnowledge(2000)`), NOT full multi-draft player decision trajectories or strategic preference.
     - Preserved normalized base-2 Jensen-Shannon Divergence mathematics.

2. **Research-to-Runtime Ledger Reconciliation (`docs/research/v026-research-runtime-ledger.md`)**:
   - Corrected all non-existent paths from v0.26 ledger to verified repository paths:
     - `src/core/world/laws.ts` → `src/core/emergence/worldLaws.ts`
     - `src/core/tech/techGraph.ts` → `src/core/tech/graph.ts` & `src/core/emergence/offerEngine.ts`
     - `src/core/territory/` → `src/core/world/territory.ts` & `src/core/emergence/outpostLogistics.ts`
     - `src/renderer/scenes/TechMapScene.ts` → `src/game/tech/TechMapView.ts` & `src/game/tech/TechGraphLayout.ts`
     - `src/core/director/phasedDirector.ts` → `src/core/emergence/director.ts` (`SCAFFOLD_ONLY`)
     - `src/core/ecology/` → `src/core/emergence/enemyEcology.ts` (`SCAFFOLD_ONLY`)
     - `src/core/events/` → `src/core/emergence/events.ts` (`SCAFFOLD_ONLY`)
     - `src/renderer/audio/` → `src/game/audio/sfx.ts` (`PARTIAL`)
     - `src/renderer/assets/` → `src/game/assets/seedAssets.ts`
   - Every system classified across: Source Exists, Canonical Sim Invoked, UI Exposed, Automated Tests, and Human Evidence.

3. **Human QA Pipeline & Privacy Hardening**:
   - `scripts/qa-report.mjs`: Added `sanitizePrivacy` redacting local filesystem paths (`C:\Users\...`, `/home/...`, `file:///...`), emails, and non-loopback IPs from committable reports.
   - Added `Evidence & Gate Classification` section: forbids labeling any report as `HUMAN_FUN_PASS` without explicit recorded human ratings.
   - `docs/playtests/PLAYTEST_PROTOCOL_V026.md`: Fixed instructions so testers do not run `npm run dev` simultaneously with `npm run qa:human`, preventing port 5173 collisions.

4. **Games User Research Protocol (`docs/playtests/PLAYTEST_PROTOCOL_V0261.md`)**:
   - Replaced heavy 8-run burden for novices with a two-stage qualitative protocol:
     - **Stage A**: Unmoderated/lightly moderated 15-minute blind first-run (3–5 novices) + neutral interview + Likert ratings.
     - **Stage B**: Focused counterbalanced paired comparisons (Hunters vs Sentinels on same seed, or Seed Alpha vs Seed Beta on Engineers).
     - 8-run factorial matrix preserved in appendix for specialized balance audits.
   - Enforces observation vs interpretation vs recommendation separation.
